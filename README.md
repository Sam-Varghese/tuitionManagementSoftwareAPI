# Tuition Management System API

This is an Application Programming Interface made in order to handle the requests send by [Tuition Management Software](https://github.com/Sam-Varghese/tuitionManagementSoftware)

It can handle post and get requests send by the software in order to get the information of all the students and classes. [Code](./paulClassesAPI.js) has been well documented, hence kindly check it out to know things in detail.

This API has not been connected with the database. Hence it temporarily fetches data from online API's and send them to the application.
