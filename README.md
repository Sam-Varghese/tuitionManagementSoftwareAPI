# Tuition Management System API

This is an Application Programming Interface made in order to handle the requests send by [Tuition Management Software](https://github.com/Sam-Varghese/tuitionManagementSoftware)

It can handle post and get requests send by the software in order to get the information of all the students and classes. [Code](./paulClassesAPI.js) has been well documented, hence kindly check it out to know things in detail.

This API has not been connected with the database. Hence it temporarily fetches data from online API's and send them to the application.

## Run the API

In order to start the server, you  need to execute the following command

`nodemon paulClassesAPI.js` (Name of coaching class is paul classes :) )

Here I assume that you have nodemon already installed. If not, then execute

`npm i -g nodemon` first
